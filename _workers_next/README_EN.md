# LDC Shop (Cloudflare Workers Edition)

[中文说明](./README.md)

---


Serverless virtual goods store built with **Next.js 16**, **Cloudflare Workers** (OpenNext), **D1 Database**, and **Shadcn UI**.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

This version adopts the cutting-edge **Next.js on Workers** approach, rather than a traditional single-file Worker:

*   **Core Framework**: **Next.js 16 (App Router)** - Maintains the same modern development experience as the Vercel version.
*   **Adapter**: **OpenNext (Cloudflare Adapter)** - The most advanced solution for deployed Next.js on Workers, supporting most Next.js features.
*   **Database**: **Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)** - Edge-native relational database, replacing Vercel Postgres.
*   **ORM**: **Drizzle ORM** - Perfectly adapted for D1, providing type-safe SQL operations.
*   **Deployment**: **Wrangler** - One-click deployment to the global edge network.

This architecture aims to combine the development efficiency of Next.js with the edge performance and low cost advantages of Cloudflare.

## 🚀 One-Click Deploy

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fchatgptuk%2Fldc-shop&env=OAUTH_CLIENT_ID,OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET,MERCHANT_ID,MERCHANT_KEY,ADMIN_USERS,NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL&envDescription=Required%20Environment%20Variables&project-name=ldc-shop&repository-name=ldc-shop&stores=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22postgres%22%7D%5D)

Click the button above to deploy your own instance to Vercel.

The database (Vercel Postgres) will be automatically provisioned and linked.

## ☁️ Cloudflare Workers Command Deploy

See [`_workers_v2/README.md`](./_workers_v2/README.md) for Wrangler-based deployment and configuration steps.

## 💡 Recommendation: Custom Domain

While the system supports active order status querying, for the best user experience (instant payment status updates), we still **recommend** binding a custom domain (e.g., `store.yourdomain.com`).

The shared `vercel.app` domain is sometimes flagged by firewalls or payment gateways, which might delay or block payment callbacks. Using a custom domain avoids these issues.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment (Docker Compose)

> ⚠️ **Experimental**: Docker deployment has not been fully tested and may have unknown issues. **We recommend using Vercel deployment** for better stability.

If you have your own server (VPS/NAS), you can deploy simply with Docker:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chatgptuk/ldc-shop.git
    cd ldc-shop
    ```
2.  Edit `docker-compose.yml` environment variables:
    - This file starts a local PostgreSQL database by default.
    - **Crucial**: Replace `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MERCHANT_ID`, `MERCHANT_KEY` with your actual credentials.
3.  Start the service:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
4.  Visit `http://localhost:3000`.
    - Database data is persisted in the local `./postgres-data` folder.

## 🔄 How to Enable Auto Update

If you forked this project, you can enable GitHub Actions to automatically sync the latest code from upstream (triggering a Vercel redeploy):

1.  Go to your GitHub repository page.
2.  Click the **Actions** tab.
3.  Select **Upstream Sync** from the left sidebar.
4.  Click the **Enable workflow** button.
5.  (Optional) Click **Run workflow** to test it manually.

Once enabled, the script will check for updates from `chatgptuk/ldc-shop:main` daily and merge them into your repository.


## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

The following environment variables are required.

> **⚠️ NOTE**: 
> The following configuration uses `store.chatgpt.org.uk` as an example. **Please replace it with your ACTUAL domain when deploying!**

### 1. Linux DO Connect (OIDC)
Go to [connect.linux.do](https://connect.linux.do) to create/configure:

*   **App Name**: `LDC Store Next` (or any name)
*   **App Homepage**: `https://store.chatgpt.org.uk`
*   **App Description**: `LDC Store Next`
*   **Callback URL**: `https://store.chatgpt.org.uk/api/auth/callback/linuxdo`

Get **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, and fill them into environment variables as `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` (**Secret recommended**).

### 2. EPay (Linux DO Credit)
Go to [credit.linux.do](https://credit.linux.do) to create/configure:

*   **App Name**: `LDC Store Next` (or any name)
*   **App Address**: `https://store.chatgpt.org.uk`
*   **Callback URI**: `https://store.chatgpt.org.uk/callback`
*   **Notify URL**: `https://store.chatgpt.org.uk/api/notify`

Get **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, and fill them into environment variables as `MERCHANT_ID` and `MERCHANT_KEY` (**Secret recommended**).

For GitHub OAuth App, set **Authorization callback URL** to:
`<your-full-site-url>/api/auth/callback/github`

Example:
`https://shop.chatgpt.org.uk/api/auth/callback/github`

It must exactly match the protocol and domain of `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (no extra trailing slash).

GitHub OAuth App creation steps:

1. Open [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers).
2. Go to **OAuth Apps** and click **New OAuth App**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Application name**: any name (for example `LDC Shop`)
   - **Homepage URL**: your full site URL (must match `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`)
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `<your-full-site-url>/api/auth/callback/github`
4. Click **Register application**.
5. Copy **Client ID**, then click **Generate a new client secret** to get **Client Secret**.
6. Set Worker environment variables:
   - `GITHUB_ID` = Client ID
   - `GITHUB_SECRET` = Client Secret (recommended as Secret)

### 3. Other Variables
*   **ADMIN_USERS**: Admin usernames, comma separated (supports Linux DO usernames and GitHub usernames in `gh_GitHub用户名` format, e.g., `chatgpt,gh_octocat`) (**Secret recommended**).
*   **NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL**: Your full app URL (e.g., `https://store.chatgpt.org.uk`). **Must be Text, not Secret**.

> Important: For a GitHub account to be recognized as admin, `ADMIN_USERS` must contain `gh_GitHub用户名` (for example `gh_octocat`). Using just `octocat` will not work.

## 🔌 Card Auto-Replenish API Integration

You can configure Card API auto-replenish per product in the admin `Card Inventory` page.

### Trigger Timing

- On enable: the system immediately tries to pull 1 card key.
- Manual pull: when clicking `Pull 1 Card`, it pulls 1 card key.
- Auto-replenish: after each successful delivery, it auto-pulls 1 card key (no cron required).

### Request Rules

- Method: `GET`
- URL: uses the exact API URL you configured in admin, as-is
- No automatic `productId` append/replace
- Optional header:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (sent only when token is configured)
- Fixed header:
  - `Accept: application/json, text/plain;q=0.9, */*;q=0.8`

### Response Requirements

Each request should return one deliverable card key. Supported response formats:

1. Plain text (`text/plain`)

```text
ABC-DEF-123
```

2. JSON direct fields (any one of them)

```json
{ "cardKey": "ABC-DEF-123" }
```

```json
{ "card": "ABC-DEF-123" }
```

```json
{ "key": "ABC-DEF-123" }
```

```json
{ "code": "ABC-DEF-123" }
```

3. JSON nested fields (recursive extraction from `data` / `result` / `item`)

```json
{ "data": { "cardKey": "ABC-DEF-123" } }
```

```json
{ "result": { "item": { "code": "ABC-DEF-123" } } }
```

4. JSON array (the first valid card key will be used)

```json
[{ "cardKey": "ABC-DEF-123" }, { "cardKey": "XYZ-999-888" }]
```

### Recommended Status Codes

- Success: return `200`
- Failure (out of stock/auth invalid/invalid params): return `4xx/5xx`

Your API should avoid returning duplicate card keys. Duplicate keys will be rejected by the store's uniqueness constraints.
